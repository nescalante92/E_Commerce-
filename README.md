## Description

As a Developer it is important to understand databases and their relationships to API requests. This task is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by configuring a working Express.js API by using Sequelize in order to interact with a MySQL database.

-------------------

## User Story

As a manager at an internet retail company
I would like a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies,
so my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

--------------------

## Acceptance Criteria

-   When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.

-   When I enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.

-   When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

-   When I open API GET routes in Postman for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

-   When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Postman, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
